# javaScript-drawings
It's a small gallery, which contains 14 javaScript drawings of mine. Every javaScript code is displayed on its own canvas. You can click on the canvas that contains the drawing, you are interested in. After your click an overlay will slide down with the code that belongs to the drawing you chose. With the "x" button can slide up the overlay with the code, and go back to the gallery.

# Built with:
Html5,
CSS,
javaScript (all of the drawings. script.js contains this.),
jQuery (animation, and click function. click.js contains this)

First, I built the drawings, one by one in JSBin. After they working surely, I built from them a gallery in my desktop editor, brackets. Finally I added the jQuery functions.
I linked font-family from google fonts.
